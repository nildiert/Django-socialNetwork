# Django-socialNetwork


Django provides some useful tools that can allow you develop a social application, which means that users are able to join an online platform and interact with each other by sharing content. I focused on building an image sharing platform. Users can be able to bookmark any image on the Internet and share it with others. They also be able to see activity on the platform from the users they follow and like/unlike the images shared by them.


### Django tools used
---

> In construction ...

| Tool | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| [Data models](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/db/models/) | A model is the single, definitive source of information about your data. It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you’re storing. Generally, each model maps to a single database table. |
| [Migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/migrations/) | Migrations are Django’s way of propagating changes you make to your models (adding a field, deleting a model, etc.) into your database schema. They’re designed to be mostly automatic, but you’ll need to know when to make migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into. |
| [Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/views/) | A view function, or view for short, is a Python function that takes a Web request and returns a Web response. This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image . . . or anything, really. The view itself contains whatever arbitrary logic is necessary to return that response. |
| [Templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/templates/) | Django’s template engine provides a powerful mini-language for defining the user-facing layer of your application, encouraging a clean separation of application and presentation logic. Templates can be maintained by anyone with an understanding of HTML; no knowledge of Python is required. For introductory material, see Templates topic guide. |
| [URL dispatcher](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/) | A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality Web application. Django lets you design URLs however you want, with no framework limitations. |
| [Object pagination](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/pagination/) | Django provides high-level and low-level ways to help you manage paginated data – that is, data that’s split across several pages, with “Previous/Next” links. |
| [Django Forms](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/forms/) | Django provides a range of tools and libraries to help you build forms to accept input from site visitors, and then process and respond to the input. |
| [Model Forms](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/forms/modelforms/) | If you’re building a database-driven app, chances are you’ll have forms that map closely to Django models. For instance, you might have a BlogComment model, and you want to create a form that lets people submit comments. In this case, it would be redundant to define the field types in your form, because you’ve already defined the fields in your model. |
| [Email System](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/email/) | Although Python provides a mail sending interface via the smtplib module, Django provides a couple of light wrappers over it. These wrappers are provided to make sending email extra quick, to help test email sending during development, and to provide support for platforms that can’t use SMTP. |
| [Tags](https://django-taggit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | ```django-taggit``` is a reusable Django application designed to make adding tagging to your project easy and fun. |
| [QuerySets](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/querysets/) | Internally, a QuerySet can be constructed, filtered, sliced, and generally passed around without actually hitting the database. No database activity actually occurs until you do something to evaluate the queryset. |
| [Custom template tags](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/custom-template-tags/) | Django’s template language comes with a wide variety of built-in tags and filters designed to address the presentation logic needs of your application. Nevertheless, you may find yourself needing functionality that is not covered by the core set of template primitives. You can extend the template engine by defining custom tags and filters using Python, and then make them available to your templates using the ```{% load %}``` tag. |
| [Sitemap](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/sitemaps/) | A sitemap is an XML file on your website that tells search-engine indexers how frequently your pages change and how “important” certain pages are in relation to other pages on your site. This information helps search engines index your site. The Django sitemap framework automates the creation of this XML file by letting you express this information in Python code. |
| [RSS](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/syndication/) | Django comes with a high-level syndication-feed-generating framework for creating RSS and Atom feeds.  Django also comes with a lower-level feed-generating API. Use this if you want to generate feeds outside of a Web context, or in some other lower-level way. |
| [Full-text search engine](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/postgres/search/) | The database functions in the django.contrib.postgres.search module ease the use of PostgreSQL’s full text search engine. |
| [Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/install/) | This is a Python implementation of John Gruber's Markdown. |
